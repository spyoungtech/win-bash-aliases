Ever have this problem?

```
C:\Users\You\> vi foo.txt
'vi' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Well, no more! Proxy unix commands to WSL from your Windows native shell with `win-bash-aliases`

Mix windows and bash commands
```
C:\Users\You>dir | grep bytes
               6 File(s)          4,195 bytes
               7 Dir(s)  191,543,554,048 bytes free
```

vi in cmd and powershell!

Your favorite unix command not here? Open a PR and I'll add it! It's as simple as adding a string to a list.

Note: some commands, like `xargs`, are impractical to use because they would execute inside the WSL environment.

## FAQ

ðŸ¤·

You should expect some things not to behave perfectly at this stage in development.

> How does it work?

Just console entry points and wrapping around `bash -c`
