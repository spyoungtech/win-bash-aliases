Ever have this problem?

C:\Users\You\> vi foo.txt
'vi' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
```

Well, no more! Proxy unix commands to WSL from your Windows native shell with `win-bash-aliases`

Your favorite unix command not here? Open a PR and I'll add it! It's as simple as adding a string to a list.

Note: some commands, like `xargs`, are impractical to use because they would execute inside the WSL environment.
